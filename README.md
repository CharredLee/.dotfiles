# charlie's dotfiles

the content of these dotfiles started as a fork of
[ZaneyOS](https://gitlab.com/Zaney/zaneyos). much of the code in here is still
explicitly from that repo. however, much of the content has been completely
overhauled, including:

- a wholly different [stylix](https://github.com/danth/stylix) theme, using
  [catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/),
- a totally different [waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar),
- a highly personalized [nvf](https://github.com/NotAShelf/nvf) configuration,

and more. also, some code (especially that of the waybar) is directly
taken/converted into nix from
[JaKooLit's dotfiles](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots), specifically,
the waybar, which is JaKooLit's catppuccin-mocha themed waybar. attributions are
in comments in every file where code was copied, so feel free to search this
repo for "JaKooLit" to find where that code is used.

because JaKooLit's code is released under the GNU public license but ZaneyOS is
released under the MIT license, both are included.
